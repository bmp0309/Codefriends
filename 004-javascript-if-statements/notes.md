JavaScript Conditional Logic
   -I learned the meanings of many logical operators
   -IF statements - any expression can be placed inside the    parenthesis as long as it can evaluate into a boolean value.
   -IF Statements aren't too strict about interpreting True or False as in Javascript there is Truthy and Falsy.

JavaScript Variables
    -Declaring a variable starts with the words Let or Const
    -Variable labels can't start with numbers or most special characters
    -Const will not allow you to change the value of the variable after it has been declared
